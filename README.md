# LISP-exercises
A repository for solutions to exercises from the  book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-LISPcraft-Robert-Wilensky/dp/0393955443"> Common LISPcraft by Robert Wilensky </a>, my attempts at solving the infamous 99 LISP problems and other stuff. The book was a classic back in the 90s, but is actually poor by comtemporrary standards with few exercised and confusing choices like ```car``` and ```cdr```
instead of ```first``` and ```rest```. Things like macros are barely mentioned toward the end of the book and so on.
